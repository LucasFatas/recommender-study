#### Main problems encountered
 

##### Problem 1
- Description: Problems when connecting front-end and back-end
- Reaction: We didn’t establish clear pathways and endpoints in the beginning and that led to many problems when connecting both parts of the application. 


 
##### Problem 2
- Description: Back-End Testing
- Reaction: There were many different ways to test the backend and we had a hard time to decide what and how the backend should be tested
 
#### Adjustments for next sprint
- Solve problem 1 by making use of Postman’s shared collections functionality and joint sessions where we connected everything together, allowing for easy identification of both frontend and backend problems
- Start updating documentation
- Continue fixing the application
- Implement user testing results 
- Have better documentation
