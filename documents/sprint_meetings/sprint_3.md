#### Main problems encountered
 


##### Problem 1
- Description: We had a resit week so some of our teammates were busy with that.
- Reaction: It somehow delayed us in the midterm presentation and the development
 
##### Problem 2
- Description: We had a midterm presentation this week so we couldn’t really finish all the sprints, due to this and the previous problem before.
- Reaction: We couldn’t really finish the sprint issues assigned

##### Problem 3
- Description: Our communication with our client is good however we were unclear on some important features in the requirements list
- Reaction: A final draft of the requirements will be made during a meeting with the client to make sure we are implementing what the client wants

##### Problem 4
- Description: The gitlab and commit messages are very messy and unstructured.
- Reaction: We are going to have a group meeting to draft up a document for git commits, merge and commits.
 
#### Adjustments for next sprint
- We don’t have tasks that are that time consuming so we should be good and it should go in a smooth way.
- There are many tasks from this sprint that need to be done next sprint.
- Take into account the new commit rules when committing, merging, commenting
- Work on the creation of a pipeline
- Try to structure the dispatch of tasks as 
- Try to improve efficiency of communications with client and TA
- Have more organized sprints but the chair now knows his role.
